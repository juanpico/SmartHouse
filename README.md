# Real-time demand response in smart homes through direct lookahead approximation

## Description

This repository contains the code to implement the smart house sequential optimization problem. We developed a deterministic 
direct lookahead approach (DLA) which controls shiftable appliance usage and energy storage while minimizing electricity costs and user discomfort.
The proposed approach considers the dynamic nature of the problem, considering uncertain information about electricity prices, energy generation, and energy demand.

The repository is structured as follows:
1. Sequential model: Contains the code for the smart house environment, policies, policy evaluation, result visualization and dashboard.
2. Forecasting models: Contains the code for the training and evaluation of the final forecasting models used for the DLA.
